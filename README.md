CEdict-parser
-------------

A very simple parser for the Chinese CEdict file, written in Python.

You can also optionally load the contents into MongoDB, by changing the `load_to_mongo` parameter to True.

This has no external requirements, except PyMongo if you wish to load the definitions into Mongo:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
